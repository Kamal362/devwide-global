      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>I'm a <span class="highlight">software engineer</span> with a relentless passion for building robust, scalable, and secure systems. With a focus on <span class="highlight">backend development</span> and <span class="highlight">cybersecurity</span>, I thrive on solving complex problems and creating solutions that make a real impact.</p>
      <p>Over the years, I've honed my skills in designing high-performance APIs, securing sensitive data, and optimizing systems for peak efficiency. Whether it's defending against cyber threats or architecting seamless backend infrastructures, I'm always up for a challenge.</p>
      <p>When I'm not coding, you'll find me exploring the latest in tech trends, contributing to open-source projects, or mentoring aspiring developers. I believe in the power of technology to transform lives, and I'm committed to pushing the boundaries of what's possible.</p>
